Survey essentials
=================

Companies often use surveys to collect valuable information from their customers and/or
employees, which they use to make more informed business decisions.

Surveys can be used for a number of different purposes. They can be used to collect customer
feedback, evaluate the success of a recent event, measure the satisfaction of customers (and
employees), learn what the market is *really* thinking, and so much more.

Getting started
===============

To begin, click *Create* on the Surveys dashboard.

Odoo then takes you a blank survey template form. First, choose a title for your survey. You can
also add a cover image to your survey by clicking the photo icon here, as well, but it's not
required.

Below are the various tabs in which you can create, customize, and configure your survey:
*Questions*, *Description*, and *Options*

Questions tab
=============

Users add sections and questions to their survey in the *Questions* tab, by clicking the
respective links (*Add a section* and *Add a question*).

Clicking *Add a question* opens a pop-up. This is where you create and customize your survey
question.

Create questions
----------------

After the question has been written in the "Question" field, you choose the "Question Type." A
preview of the question type is shown in this window, as well.

You can choose from the following:

* **Multiple Lines Text Box**
* **Single Line Text Box**
* **Numerical Value**
* **Date**
* **Datetime**
* **Multiple choice: only one answer**
* **Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed**
* **Matrix**

.. note::
   Each "Question Type" reveals different features/options in the *Answers* and *Options* tab that
   are specific to that unique "Question Type." However, the *Description* tab will always remain
   the same.

Custom features
---------------

Once a "Question Type" has been selected, you can modify your question in the *Answers*,
*Description*, and *Options* tab, which offer up a variety of different features (depending on
what "Question Type" you are working on).

Odoo provides the user with a plethora of professional features and options, so be sure to check
each tab for an array of unique aspects. There are a number of things you can do to enhance the
quality of your question.

For example, you can choose to validate an entry, make an answer mandatory, or activate
"Conditional Display."

"Conditional Display"
---------------------

"Conditional Display" means this question will only be displayed if the specified conditional
answer has been selected in a previous question.

If the box next to "Conditional Display" is selected, the "Triggering Question" field appears.
Once a "Triggering Question" is picked, a "Triggering Answer" field appears.

Here, you select which answer triggers this "Conditional Display" question.

   When you are done, remember to hit *Save & Close*, which takes you back to the survey template
   page. You can also hit *Save & New* to instantly start working on another question.

Description tab
===============

Back on the survey template page, you can click into the *Description* tab to write a custom
description for your survey, which is displayed beneath the title on the survey's homepage.

this a certification.
